            I live in a beautiful Buckinghamshire village, with my husband and
            Yellow Labrador Bella. The combination of moving to a house, which
            backs onto fields with far reaching views, and becoming a grandma
            inspired me to start writing. I have always loved nature and animals
            and I am so lucky to have many different species of wildlife
            visiting my garden. One day I sat watching a newt in my pond, and
            started to imagine what he was getting up to. This led me to write,
            'Noah the Newt' for my granddaughter's 1st birthday. I really
            enjoyed penning my first story and felt compelled to write more.

            I left school before taking any exams, but I remember English was my
            favourite lesson, especially writing essays. The launch of my first
            book, 'Figg the Funky Fox and other read aloud Rhymes', with the
            help of my amazing illustrator, Alicia Howard has made me feel so
            proud of myself. Knowing that children are reading my stories and
            connecting with the animal kingdom gives me great pleasure.
            Throughout my life I have lacked confidence and self-worth, but
            writing has made me realise that anything is possible if you really
            believe in yourself.

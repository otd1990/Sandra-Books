          <p>
            I live in the beautiful village of Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire,
            with my husband and Yellow Labrador Bella. The combination of moving
            to Hare House, which backs onto fields and has far fetching
            countryside views, and becoming a grandma inspired me to start
            writing. I have always loved nature and animals and I am so lucky to
            have many different species of wildlife visit my garden. One day
            during Covid, I sat watching a newt in my pond. I started to imagine
            what he was getting up to which led me to write, 'Noah the Newt' for
            my granddaughters' 1st birthday. I really enjoyed penning my first
            story and felt compelled to write more.

            I left school before taking any exams, but I remember English
            lessons were a favourite, especially writing essays. The launch of
            my first book, 'Figg the Funky Fox and other read aloud Rhymes',
            with the help of my amazing illustrator, Alicia Howard and Husband
            Chris, has made me feel so proud of myself. Knowing that children
            are reading my stories and connecting with the animal kingdom gives
            me great pleasure. Throughout my life I have lacked confidence and
            self-worth, but writing has made me realise that anything is
            possible if you really believe in yourself.
